# Tello Mission Command Center
## Introduction
This year I have been working on a project related to search and rescue operations. As part of the project, I designed, developed, and manufactured a device that is delivered to a lost person's location by drone. My favorite part of the project was watching the device take flight. Having no prior experience with drones made that flight so much more exciting for me. It left me wanting to know more about drones. Since then, I have done all I can to learn about drones. A dozen YouTube videos, one python book, and roughly one hundred dollars later... Here we are.

Welcome to the Tello Mission Command Center!

The mission command center allows you to control a DJI Tello from your computer. This includes access to the drone's onboard camera. You can control all basic flight movements of the drone: Throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll. To learn more about these movements check out this lesson by [Robolink](https://www.robolink.com/snap-lesson-3/). You can also command the drone to takeoff, land, or take a photo. Future updates will introduce additional functionality.

## Discussion
There is so much you can do with drones. This program is just the tip of the iceberg! Future updates will include:
1. Safety protocols.
2. Merging multiple windows.
3. A GUI with interactive icons, menus, and audio.
4. Autonomy through machine learning and computer vision techniques.
5. The handling of multiple drones.
